# Library

Simple library app that allows users to add / remove books

Learning Outcomes: 
 - DOM Manipulation

## Project was completed as part of The Odin Project [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript)

Later in the course I will revisit this app to add local storage and responsiveness.
